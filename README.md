ICBM
===========

![Screen shot.](screenshot.jpg)

This is my take on a classic Atari video game, Missile Command.

Loading the page "Applet.html" within a browser should (maybe) start the program.
Failing that, from a command line you can try "appletviewer Applet.html".
The game can also be found at [this page](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~jpsember/sfu/icbm.html).
